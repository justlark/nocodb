NocoDB supports webhooks to notify external systems in real time whenever records are created, updated, or deleted within a table. This allows seamless integration with third-party services by triggering automated workflows or syncing data changes as they happen. Webhooks in NocoDB are configured per table and can be tailored with custom payloads, headers, and event-specific triggers to fit diverse automation needs.

This article discusses webhook v3, which is the latest version of webhooks in NocoDB. It includes a new user interface and additional features compared to the previous version. For more information on the differences between webhook v2 and v3, please refer to the [Webhook v2 vs v3](/automation/webhook-v3/webhook-v2-vs-v3) article.

Webhook v2 will be deprecated in the future, and users are encouraged to migrate to webhook v3 for enhanced functionality and support. For legacy users, [webhook v2](/automation/webhook/webhook-overview) will continue to be supported for a limited time, but new features and improvements will only be available in webhook v3.
